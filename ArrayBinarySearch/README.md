# Insert to Middle of an Array
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used the Problem solving, Visual, Algorithm, Psuedo, Code, Verification approach respectively to map out the way to to solve the issue at hand.

Big O moment when I went back to the psuedocode in order to add the 
INPUT instead of the array.
