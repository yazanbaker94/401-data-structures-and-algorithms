# Challenge Summary
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time Complexity: O(n^2) 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Boundary Cases: Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order. And it takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

## Solution
INPUT: 

[12, 11, 13, 5, 6 ]; 

OUTPUT:

[5, 6, 11, 12, 13 ];
